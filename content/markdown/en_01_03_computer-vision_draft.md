In the field of computer vision our main area of expertise is in  the analysis historical, handwritten manuscripts and printed/typed documents. Besides creating searchable, full-text transcripts (HTR/OCR), we also have experience in analysing the visual characteristics of historical documents to address other tasks such as determining authorship, dating and localizing texts, identifying specific entities such as people, places, dates in the text, and classifying images.

To convert images of typed or printed text into machine-readable text (OCR), we generally rely on either commercial (e.g. Abbyy) or open source (e.g. Tesseract) software in combination with custom pre-processing methods to improve the quality of the images for the text recognition applications. Following this, for many projects we make use of a further set of custom post-correction tools such as piccl and ticcl to convert orthographic letter variants into standard forms allowing these to be better matched against historical dictionaries and similar references.

In the case of historical manuscripts, we can also draw on available commercial software (e.g. Transkribus) to provide machine-readable texts from hand-written texts (HTR). However, for many types of research projects, it is beneficial to be able to draw on open source software to have full control over operation of the all different steps in HTR process. To this end, we have created our own machine learning based HTR software for the National Archives and the Globalise proejcts to transcribe over ten million, 16-18th century handwritten Dutch manuscript pages. In addition, we've developed open source tools to aid researchers with the automatic classification and clustering of different document types (e.g. wills, contracts, letters..) and to support searches on the basis of similar parts of a document (e.g. letterheads or family crests).

### Research Projects

+ what did we contribute to each of these projects?

- [Republic](https://en.huygens.knaw.nl/projecten/resoluties-staten-generaal-1576-1796-de-oerbronnen-van-de-parlementaire-democratie/?noredirect=en_GB) (Huygens Institute) stands for REsolutions PUBLished In a Computational environment. The goal of the project is to make all of the manuscript and printed resolutions of the Dutch States General (1576-1796) freely available online as full texts and page images. Work on Republic began in 2019 and is scheduled to end in 2024.
- [Globalise](https://globalise.huygens.knaw.nl) (Huygens Institute). Consisting of approximately twenty-five million pages, the archives of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) offer a unique view on interactions between European and non-European actors in Asia in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. However, doing research on this collection of handwritten documents is currently extremely challenging. Globalise will develop an online infrastructure that will make the VOC reports easily accessible for advanced new research methods.
- [TRIADO](https://www.oorlogsbronnen.nl/nieuws/veelbelovende-resultaten-onderzoek-naar-digitaal-doorzoekbaar-maken-cabr) (KNAW Humanities Cluster). After the Second World War, more than 300,000 Dutch citizens were subjected to the so-called special administration of justice. They were accused of collaboration with the German occupier, treason, membership in the Dutch National Socialist Movement (NSB) or having enlisted in the German military. Files on all these people are kept in the [Central Archive: Special Criminal Jurisdiction (CABR)](https://www.nationaalarchief.nl/onderzoeken/zoekhulpen/tweede-wereldoorlog-centraal-archief-bijzondere-rechtspleging-cabr). The goal of the TRIADO project is to make the entire CABR collection fully searchable and accessible.
- [Digital Forensics](https://www.huygens.knaw.nl/projecten/digital-forensics-for-historical-documents/?noredirect=nl_NL) (Huygens Institute) aims at creating a bridge in between two different modes of handwriting analyses: forensic (graph analysis) and palaeographical (the development of scripts through space and time). In Digital Forensics, the two methods will be combined in a single •deep learning system• to analyse the similarities and deviances in handwritten script in a palaeographically meaningful manner.
