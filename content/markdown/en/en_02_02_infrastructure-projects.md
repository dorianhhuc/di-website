Infrastructure projects, both national and European, are an important part of the Digital Infrastructure section of the KNAW Humanities Cluster. These projects contribute directly to the department's goal of creating an infrastructure for humanities research.

Our developers have extensive experience in setting up and implementing complex infrastructure projects. Even after these projects are completed, the DI department usually continues to play a major role in managing the infrastructure that has been delivered.

The Digital Infrastructure department is always open to new collaborations and new infrastructure projects for the humanities. Please contact us to discuss what our role and added value can be.
