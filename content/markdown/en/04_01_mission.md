The Digital Infrastructure (DI) department of the [KNAW Humanities Cluster](https://huc.knaw.nl/) builds sustainable infrastructures for innovative humanities research for the Netherlands and abroad. In this way, DI supports the researchers of the Humanities Cluster. The infrastructure created in these projects is open source and available according to FAIR principles to all humanities researchers, research software engineers, the education sector, and the heritage sector. Finally, the DI department sets national and international standards with its partners and plays a central role in the management of websites, tools and digital collections for the Humanities Cluster.
