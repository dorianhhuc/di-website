Infrastructure projects are an important part of the Digital Infrastructure department. These projects contribute directly to the department's goal of creating a European and national infrastructure for humanities research. These are almost always projects in which there is intensive collaboration with other parties from the humanities or heritage sector.

[CLARIAH](https://www.clariah.nl) is the most important infrastructure project we are working on at the moment. In CLARIAH, we are working with several universities and various heritage institutions on facilities for digital humanities research. Our department occupies a key technical position and HuC leads several of its work packages.

Our developers have  extensive experience in setting up and implementing complex projects of this kind. The output of such projects are often reusable components. Thus, even after these projects have been completed, the our department usually continues to play a major role in managing the delivered infrastructure. A large collection of our open source software can be found on our [GitHub](https://github.com/knaw-huc) repository. 

We are always open to new collaborations and new infrastructure projects for the humanities. Please contact us to discuss what our role and added value could be.
