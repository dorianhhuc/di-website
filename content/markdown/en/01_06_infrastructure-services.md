The Digital Infrastructure Department of the Humanities Cluster provides a powerful, stable, secure and multifunctional infrastructure for individual researchers, research groups and collection processing institutions. We have extensive knowledge and experience of this research and collection infrastructure and our user groups. This enables us to think along before, during and after a research or collection project. Together with our user groups, we look at how our modern infrastructure can meet the needs for the short and (very) long term. If necessary, we adapt parts of the infrastructure or create new software that simplifies a work process, for example.

When a project is delivered, we ensure that it is properly integrated into the management and infrastructure landscape for the longer term. This way we ensure that research results or services remain available. TWe use techniques such as Kubernetes, Docker, vmWare and Database clusters. This makes the infrastructure scalable and sustainable.
