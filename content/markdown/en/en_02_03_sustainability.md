An important core task of the Digital Infrastructure department is to manage digital data. Not only because all research projects produce data, but also because our institutes aim to form data sets or digital collections and to make them available. This applies particularly to the IISG, which has a direct collection-building objective. We make these datasets available in a sustainable way, and as much as possible according to FAIR principles. Therefore, we are also [CoreTrustSeal](https://www.coretrustseal.org/) certified.

We carry out this work in close cooperation with the Data Management department of the Huygens Institute and with the Collections department of the IISG.
The importance of the digital collections is great; it often concerns digital heritage. For this reason, the HuC is also the formal 'hub' for the science sector within the [Digital Heritage Network](https://netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/). Our cooperation with [DANS](https://dans.knaw.nl/) is also becoming increasingly important. Recently, we have also entered into a cooperation with the [NIOD](https://www.niod.nl/), for whom we will manage the digital collections.

A large collection of datasets that we make available can be found at: [https://datasets.iisg.amsterdam/](https://datasets.iisg.amsterdam/).

#### Sustainable software and infrastructure

The DI department develops software and infrastructure as sustainably as possible. Where possible, we use existing tools and software. We continue to build on generic components to serve specific research questions. When further developing software, we always seek to collaborate with other parties. We always make the software available on open source.

The DI department has its own Concern Infrastructure team that manages the developed infrastructure and ensures secure access to it. By using techniques such as Kubernetes, Docker, vmWare and Database clusters, the infrastructure is scalable and sustainably maintained.

We invite researchers and developers to make use of this infrastructure and to build on it with us.

A large collection of Open Source software projects can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/knaw-huc). Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)
