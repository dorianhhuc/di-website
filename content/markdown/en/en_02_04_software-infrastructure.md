The DI department develops software and infrastructure as sustainably as possible. Where possible, we use existing tools and software. We continue to build on generic components in order to serve specific research questions. When further developing software, we always seek to collaborate with other parties. We always make the software available on open source.

The DI department has its own Concern Infrastructure team that manages the developed infrastructure and ensures secure access to it. By using techniques such as Kubernetes, Docker, vmWare and Database clusters, the infrastructure is scalable and sustainably maintained.

We invite researchers and developers to make use of this infrastructure and to build on it with us.
