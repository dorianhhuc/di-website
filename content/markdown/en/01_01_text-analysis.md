## Text Analysis

We have have extensive experience with diverse kinds of scholarly text collections. These include literary text editions, correspondence catalogues, as well as historical manuscripts and linguistic collections. The text collection we publish are often enhanced with supporting features such as metadata, search and browse options, page images, structured data, and annotations.

In particular, we offer researchers many ways to carry out complex searches using 'fuzzy' text patterns, semantically related passages or by filtering texts on the basis of structured data enrichments such as the persons or places mentioned in the text. We also provide the necessary know-how and software tools to allow project teams to edit, annotate, and visualize their text collections, to publish them on online, and deposit them in a certified digital repository to ensure their long term preservation and access.

Very large and complex text based projects can benefit from the open source [text repository](https://github.com/knaw-huc/textrepo) we've developed in-house at the Humanities Cluster. The software acts as a backend repository to store and index corpora with metadata and versions. An application such as a web front-end or editor can make use of the text repository's API to read, update, and delete texts or to explore or search documents.
