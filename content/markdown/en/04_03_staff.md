DI employs almost 30 people. Besides a director and a small staff for planning, consultancy and communication, most of the colleagues work in six areas of expertise: [Infrastructure Services](https://beta-huc-di.netlify.app/infrastructure-services-en.html), [Structured Data](https://beta-huc-di.netlify.app/structured-data-en.html), [Text Analysis](https://beta-huc-di.netlify.app/text-analysis-en.html), [Computer vision](https://beta-huc-di.netlify.app/computer-vision-en.html), [Spatial Computing](https://beta-huc-di.netlify.app/spatial-computing-en.html) and [Interface Design](https://beta-huc-di.netlify.app/interface-design-en.html). One team  focuses on managing the infrastructure, software and data. The other teams build software and therefore consist entirely of software engineers. Each engineer has a unique specialisation in addition to extensive experience of working in humanities research.
