DI employs almost 30 people. Besides a director and a small staff for planning, consultancy and communication, most of the colleagues work in six areas of expertise: [Infrastructure Services](beta/infrastructure-services-en.html), [Structured Data](beta/structured-data-en.html), [Text Analysis](beta/text-analysis-en.html), [Computer vision](beta/computer-vision-en.html), [Spatial Computing](beta/spatial-computing-en.html) and [Interface Design](beta/interface-design-en.html). One team  focuses on managing the infrastructure, software and data. The other teams build software and therefore consist entirely of software engineers. Each engineer has a unique specialisation in addition to extensive experience of working in humanities research.
