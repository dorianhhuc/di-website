DI employs over 25 people. Besides a director and a small staff for planning, consultancy and communication, most of the colleagues work in six areas of expertise: Concern Infrastructure, Structured Data, Text Analysis, Image Processing, Spatial Computing and Interface Design [link to pages on these, also use same temen]. The Concern Infrastructure team focuses on managing the infrastructure, software and data. The other teams build software and therefore consist entirely of software engineers. Each engineer has a unique specialisation in addition to extensive experience of working in humanities research.
