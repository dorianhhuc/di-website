The Digital Infrastructure department is a great place to work. It is one of the largest teams in Europe at the intersection of humanities research and IT. We work on national and international infrastructures with unique data for leading institutes at home and abroad. DI also works within the Humanities Cluster in a unique environment where research, data and software always go hand in hand. Due to the multitude of projects we are regularly looking for new colleagues. Whether you are a researcher specialising in application development or an IT specialist with a keen interest in the humanities, you can get started within one of our areas of expertise [link].

If you are interested in working for DI, we invite you to come and meet us. Send an open application letter with a CV, or contact us for an informal introductory interview. If there is not already a vacancy, we are sure to have one available soon.
