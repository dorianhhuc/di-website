An important core task of the Digital Infrastructure department is to manage the infrastructure for preserving digital data. Not only because all research projects produce data, but also because our institutes aim to structure data sets or digital collections and make them accessible. This applies particularly to the IISG, which has a collection-building mandate. We make these datasets available in a sustainable way, and increasingly according to [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org). This is why we are also a holder of a [CoreTrustSeal](https://www.coretrustseal.org/) certificate.

We carry out this work in close cooperation with the Data Management departments of the Humanities Cluster institutes as well as [NIOD](https://www.niod.nl). The importance of digital collections is great; they often involve our digital heritage. For this reason, the HuC is also the formal 'hub' for the research sector within the [Digital Heritage Network](https://netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/). Our cooperation with [DANS](https://dans.knaw.nl/) is also becoming increasingly important.

Many of the datasets that we make available can be found at: 

* [IISH Data Collection](https://datasets.iisg.amsterdam/)
* [Search IISG](https://meertens.knaw.nl/collecties/databanken/)
* [Meertens Instituut Databanken](https://meertens.knaw.nl/collecties/databanken/)
* [Resources Huygens](http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/)
* [Timbuctoo](http://huygensing.github.io/timbuctoo/)
* [Archieven.nl](https://www.archieven.nl/nl/)
