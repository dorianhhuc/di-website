An important core task of the Digital Infrastructure department is to manage the infrastructure for preserving digital data. Not only because all research projects produce data, but also because our institutes aim to form data sets or digital collections and to make them available. This applies particularly to the IISG, which has a direct collection-building objective. We make these datasets available in a sustainable way, and increasingly according to FAIR principles available. Therefore, we have the  [CoreTrustSeal](https://www.coretrustseal.org/) certificate.

We carry out this work in close cooperation with the Data Management department of the Huygens Institute and with the Collections department of the IISG. The importance of the digital collections is great; it often concerns our digital heritage. For this reason, the HuC is also the formal 'hub' for the research sector within the [Digital Heritage Network](https://netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/). Our cooperation with [DANS](https://dans.knaw.nl/) is also becoming increasingly important. Recently, we also entered into a cooperation with KNAW [NIOD Institute](https://www.niod.nl/), for whom we will manage their digital collections.

Many of the datasets that we make available can be found at: 

* [IISH Data Collection](https://datasets.iisg.amsterdam/)
* [Search IISG](https://meertens.knaw.nl/collecties/databanken/)
* [Meertens Instituut Databanken](https://meertens.knaw.nl/collecties/databanken/)
* [Resources Huygens](http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/)
* [Timbuctoo](http://huygensing.github.io/timbuctoo/)
* [Archieven.nl](https://www.archieven.nl/nl/)
