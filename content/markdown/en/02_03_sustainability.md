An important core task of the Digital Infrastructure department is to manage digital data. Not only because all research projects produce data, but also because our institutes aim to form data sets or digital collections and to make them available. This applies particularly to the IISG, which has a direct collection-building objective. We make these datasets available in a sustainable way, and as much as possible according to FAIR principles. Therefore, we are also [CoreTrustSeal](https://www.coretrustseal.org/) certified.

We carry out this work in close cooperation with the Data Management department of the Huygens Institute and with the Collections department of the IISG.
The importance of the digital collections is great; it often concerns digital heritage. For this reason, the HuC is also the formal 'hub' for the science sector within the [Digital Heritage Network](https://netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/). Our cooperation with [DANS](https://dans.knaw.nl/) is also becoming increasingly important. Recently, we have also entered into a cooperation with the [NIOD](https://www.niod.nl/), for whom we will manage the digital collections.

A large collection of datasets that we make available can be found at: 

- [IISH Data Collection](https://datasets.iisg.amsterdam/)
- [Search IISG](https://meertens.knaw.nl/collecties/databanken/)
- [Meertens Instituut Databanken](https://meertens.knaw.nl/collecties/databanken/)
- [Resources Huygens](http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/)
