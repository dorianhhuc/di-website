The Digital Infrastructure department works together with researchers and is therefore always open to new ideas and projects. We also like to apply existing solutions in new research projects.

Our research software engineers are specialists in their field and are happy to think along about how DI can contribute to your plans. Our Acquisition Manager and the Grant Team will be happy to discuss funding or the technical side of the project with you. We advise you to start these discussions as early as possible, when the first ideas are being formed, and not to wait until, for example, a deadline is approaching.

In addition, each institute within the Humanities Cluster has a institute coordinator DI who knows his/her way around DI and can point you in the right direction for a collaboration with DI.

Although DI was primarily set up to help researchers from the HuC institutes, the department also carries out projects in collaboration with other research organisations. Especially if these fit in with the other projects and the existing infrastructure.
