"Geographical information is a fundamental part of humanities data. All information consists, in the abstract, of 'someone doing something at a certain place'. You can hang anything on that peg and the integration of those types of information and their mutual relationships is becoming increasingly important." Speaking is Thomas Vermaut, developer and team leader of the DI geographical analysis expertise area, which deals with the processing of spatial data in digital infrastructure.

Don't just think about maps, warns Vermaut. "Geographical information is too complex for just a flat visualisation, because you have a lot of logical relationships between all kinds of geo-data. Think, for example, of the villages in Zeeland that disappeared in 1953, or all kinds of complex shifts of administrative areas such as parishes or marken (in the eastern sandy areas of the Netherlands), and their relationship to the original municipalities of the nineteenth century, and how they evolved into modern municipalities. These are important relationships to establish in order to move to a higher level in your applications. This semantic interpretation is getting better and better thanks to new techniques and standards such as Web Annotations. That is a modern way of adding annotations to every possible source. Text, images and geographical data speak the same language, as it were, and can be linked together.

One of the platforms managed by team Geo is [HisGIS](https://hisgis.nl/), which places geographical data in a historical context. "HisGIS was originally started in the 1980s as a project by Hans Mol at the Fryske Akademy. He is still in charge of the project, but since 2019 the technical infrastructure has been coordinated by the HuC," Vermaut says. The basis of HisGIS is the complete 1832 cadastre, as set up for the Netherlands by Napoleon at the time, based on the French model. "The unit we work with in HisGIS is the plot, as an atom of space. With that, you can reconstruct the entire historical context from which things arose."

Various information layers can be connected to this HisGIS base layer, such as elevation files, aerial photos or old topographic maps. This provides valuable information for historians, ecologists, site managers and landscape specialists, but also for government bodies such as provinces and municipalities. In various Time Machine projects, for example, the HisGIS data are supplemented with local historical population data, providing insight into the historical development of cities such as Amsterdam and Leiden.

"We are currently using citizen science to deploy many volunteers to open up sources," Vermaut says. "For this we use OpenStreetMap technology, which allows people to contribute from home. For example, they draw old maps in the browser or transcribe tables belonging to the plots. This data is then linked live."

Another project that team Geo is involved in is World Historical Gazetteer. "This project aims to form a histprical reference list for all possible mentions of a 'place' around the world," Vermaut explains. "Different datasets are brought together into one list, to which users can also add data themselves. Our team made version 2.0 of this software possible, which was launched in the summer of 2021. As HuC, we also contributed to the Dutch Global History collection for Dutch historical place names and other place names related to Dutch history."
