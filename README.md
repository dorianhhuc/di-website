# DI-website
KNAW Digital Infrastructure website

## Content
Content for the website can be placed in the folder `content`. Markdown files can be put in the `markdown` folder and images in the `images` folder.

Hi Arno, can you, for now, store it in just one folder? After our meeting yesterday I had an idea about using only the markdown files and no spreadsheet. The idea is to use the site structure in the naming of the files.

`nl_00_00-home.md`

`nl_01_00_expertise.md`

`en_00_00-home.md`

`en_01_00_expertise.md`


## Metadata
Extra metadata (like author and publication date) can placed into the markdown file using YAML, example:

```
---
title: Text Analysis
author: Arno Bosse
type: page
---
```
