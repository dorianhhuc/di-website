## Text Analysis

+ 152 words but likely still too short.

We have have extensive experience in working with diverse kinds of scholarly text collections. These include literary text editions, correspondence collections, as well as historical manuscripts and linguistic collections. The text collection we publish are often enhanced by us with supporting features such as metadata, search and browse options, page images, structured data, and annotations. 

In particular, to meet a project's specific research goals, we're able to provide many ways to carry out complex textual analyses such as searching for specific or 'fuzzy' text patterns, semantically related passages or filtered searches limited to one or more enrichment layers (e.g. persons or places mentioned in the text). In addition, we also provide the necessary know-how and software to allow project teams to further edit, annotate, and visualize their text collections, publish them on online, and deposit them as research data in a digital repository to ensure their long term preservation and access.
