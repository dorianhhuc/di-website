## Interface Design

Data from the humanities is often complex and difficult to interpret. The Interface Design team makes this data accessible and understandable, both for researchers and for people outside science. So that users without domain knowledge or experience with SPARQL can also perform complex searches on the underlying datasets.

The Interface Design team specialises in user research, online usability, interface design, web publishing, data visualisation and project branding. In order to achieve an optimal end result, the designers are involved in a project at an early stage whenever possible.

The tools developed by the Interface Design team place the underlying data in the right context, making them easier to understand and use. A great deal of attention is paid to responsive design, so that the applications are accessible from different screens, from tablet to widescreen monitor. Inclusiveness is also an important principle: the tools are accessible to people with disabilities wherever possible. In addition, the design is as sustainable as possible: the team works according to open source principles, so that the application remains usable in the long term.
